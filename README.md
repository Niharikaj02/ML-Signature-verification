# ML Signature Verification
## Overview
ML Signature Verification is a web application built using Python and Flask, designed to determine the authenticity of a person's handwritten signature. The system employs machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM), in conjunction with image processing using the OTSU method.

## Key Skills
1. Python
2. Flask
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. JavaScript

## Features
Signature Verification: The web application allows users to upload an image of a handwritten signature.
Prediction: It uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether the signature is genuine or forged.
Image Processing: The system applies the OTSU method for image processing to enhance the accuracy of the prediction.
## Algorithms Used
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is employed as the machine learning algorithm for signature verification. It is a powerful classification method.
2. OTSU Method: The OTSU method is used for image processing to optimize the segmentation of the signature image.
